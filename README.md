## Reusable Food Container (RFC) System

This project aims to dramatically reduce the environmental footprint of the Cal Poly San Luis Obispo campus 
through the development of a reusable food container system. This repository contains the source code 
for the RFID tracking system to manage all customer container checkouts and returns. 

### The repository contains the following three folders with additional instructions in the corresponding directories:

**Alien Scanner**

  - Contains the Alien Reader Setup Guide and Java files for discovering, connecting to, setting up, and testing the Alien Reader.

**SQL Database**

  - Contains SQL code and instructions for creating a new database to track the containers and users in the RFC system.

**Database Visualization Website**

  - Contains source code for a website to visualize the user, container, and transaction data in the SQL database. 
  - Contains a backend server with methods for adding new users and containers to the system. Also contains
    methods for checking out containers to users and returning them through the collection bins.
